Goal is to be able to parse a tree with a neural network.

Found theses recources which seem useful

Some ideas I have, and think I should test out
- Just train a CNN on it, and it will probably learn something useful
- Test with just an RNN with some positional token
- Hm, when thinking about it, might be easier to just train an CNN on the entire tree represented.

I also need a easier way to publish dataset so I can use it on lambda.
