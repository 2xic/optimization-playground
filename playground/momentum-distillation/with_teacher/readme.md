Based on the idea presented in [Align before Fuse: Vision and Language Representation Learning with Momentum Distillation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2107.07651.pdf).

However, I see similar ideas have been presented [https://assets.amazon.science/f0/3d/2080880e466c9b4d02bd3bc2d16b/exponential-moving-average-normalization-for-self-supervised-learning.pdf](https://assets.amazon.science/f0/3d/2080880e466c9b4d02bd3bc2d16b/exponential-moving-average-normalization-for-self-supervised-learning.pdf) for the task I wanted to test out.

Mainly I wanted to see if I could use a model that updates based on a Exponential Moving Average for training a student.
