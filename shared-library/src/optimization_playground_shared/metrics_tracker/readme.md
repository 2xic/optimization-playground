Very simple metrics tracker to make it easier to keep track of current training round and older runs.

# ideas
- have a git diff for each run so you have the full code state

# Other tools out there

- Nice idea for reproducibility with the decorators

## w&b
- used this before, but I think it makes sense to just have something selfhosted
