Very simple metrics tracker to make it easier to keep track of current training round and older runs.

# ideas
- have a git diff for each run so you have the full code state of that specific run

# Other tools out there

## https://github.com/IDSIA/sacred
- Nice idea for reproducibility with the decorators

## why not use w&b ? 
I have used this before, but I think it makes sense to just have something self-hosted
