# [ Neural networks [5.1] : Restricted Boltzmann machine - definition ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4Vh_zMw-HQ)
- Neural network for unsupervised learning
- Non directing graphical model
  - Learns to model the distribution using binary hidden units
  - Using a energy function which is [similar](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/409247/what-is-the-relation-between-a-loss-function-and-an-energy-function), but not hte same as a loss function
