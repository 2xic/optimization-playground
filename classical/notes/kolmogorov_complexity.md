## Kolmogorov Complexity
Given a target message $M$, what is the shortest program that outputs $M$ ? 

Language for this doesn't matter more than a constant `C` because you can always use interpreter in the program language of choice. This will always be a constant regardless of language.

It is impossible to write a program that calculates the Kolmogorov complexity of a any message. That is - there is no "perfect" compression algorithm.
- If there was a way you could just reverse the process which is not possible ofc.
