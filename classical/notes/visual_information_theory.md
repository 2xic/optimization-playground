## [Visual Information Theory](https://colah.github.io/posts/2015-09-Visual-Information/)
- Starting out with probability theory and how to visualize it with two independent variables.
  - Then goes into `Bayesâ€™ Theorem`
  - I'm not sure I completely see the way it helps to have it visualized with these boxes though (but that might just be me)
- Then it goes into Simpson's Paradox which comes up when there is confounding variable that affects a relationship (or as I would describe there is a additional variable that is not properly accounted third that affects the relationship that is measured)
- When it comes to variable length codes the visualization makes more sense again.
