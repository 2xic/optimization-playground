# [Compressing images with singular value decomposition (SVD)](https://zerobone.net/blog/cs/svd-image-compression/)
Matrices are linear transformations and SVD comines some of these operations. More specifically the idea behind SVD
- 2 Rotations operations
- One scaling operation

Image can be represented as a matrix. 

Calculating SVD is described [here](https://medium.com/intuition/singular-value-decomposition-svd-working-example-c2b6135673b5).
