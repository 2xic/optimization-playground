### [Data Compression Explained](http://mattmahoney.net/dc/dce.html#Section_1)
All data compression algorithms are based on 
- a model that estimates the probability of distribution (E is more probably than X)
- a coder that assign shorter codes to more common words

There are no [universal compression](http://mattmahoney.net/dc/dce.html#Section_11) and the [codes](http://mattmahoney.net/dc/dce.html#Section_12) are also bounded. 

*"Compression = modeling + coding. Coding is a solved problem. Modeling is provably not solvable."*

The page has many code snippets for various compression algorithms.
