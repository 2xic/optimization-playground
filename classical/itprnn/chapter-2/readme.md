# Probability, Entropy and Inference

This chapter mostly focuses on notations with some examples. I'll do some of the figures and implement some of the examples using python as I think that is the best exercise todo in this case given that is less about algorithms. 

Forward probability -> generative model that describes a process that is assumed to give rise to some data
Inverse probability -> given the observed variables, we compute the conditional probability of one or more of the unobserved variables in the process

Should likely do some of the exercise here also.
