probability theory reaches parts that ad hoc methods cannot reach.

Some unknowns concepts here like [Laplace's rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_of_succession). The chapter mainly focuses on various usage of Bayes rules which I should look more into (I mean I know about the rule, but it is applied in a very different context in this book).
