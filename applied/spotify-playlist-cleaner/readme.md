When I find a song I put it in `songs that has to be relocated`, but ideally this should happen automatically.

Goal
- Create a web service that talks to https://github.com/2xic-speedrun/wirehead/ to get song features
- Cluster them to playlist
- Reorganize the playlist, or at least give suggestions.
