Some project they mention that seem cool
- Apply [differential Training Of Rollout Policies](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2312638_Differential_Training_Of_Rollout_Policies) but with NN
- Create a parallelized version of TRPO (I say any RL algorithm, with the goal being to become good at optimizing the code)
  - They for instance mentions `Parameter Averaging in Distributed RL`
- Learned Data Augmentation
