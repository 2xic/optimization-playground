https://notebooklm.google/ is great, but has no api :( https://pdf-to-podcast.com/ was mentioned [here](https://simonwillison.net/2024/Jun/13/pdf-to-podcast/) so I'll fork it.

Original source code is [here](https://github.com/knowsuchagency/pdf-to-podcast/blob/main/main.py).

None of them worked well - I just revered the api fro [notebook lm](../notebook_lm_api/)
