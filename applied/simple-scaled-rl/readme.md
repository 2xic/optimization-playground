I was reading [Reinforcement Learning With PyBoy](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lixado/PyBoy-RL/main/README/report.pdf) and see that it has some nice [plugins](https://github.com/Baekalfen/PyBoy/tree/master/pyboy/plugins) to make it easy to apply for RL.

I want to train a RL model on Tetris at scale.


## Simulator
- Should be able to take in a model (Q-learning?) and scale up `n` instances of that environment to collection state action pairs

## Model
- Q-Learning -> Something simple, goal is to create some good experiment loops more than anything.

## Debug
- Some way to replay the model on a game easily
