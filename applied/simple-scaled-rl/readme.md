I was reading [Reinforcement Learning With PyBoy](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lixado/PyBoy-RL/main/README/report.pdf) and see that it has some nice [plugins](https://github.com/Baekalfen/PyBoy/tree/master/pyboy/plugins) to make it easy to apply for RL.

I want to train a RL model on tetris at scale.
