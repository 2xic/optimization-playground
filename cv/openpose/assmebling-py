"""
Bipartite Matching is used for doing the matching of keypoints

See algorithm for section 3.5

z[j1][j2] -> check if two detection candiates are valid

D_j = {
    [....] <- possible for partj (x,y)
    ...
    ...
    part j
}

Z = is the set of possible connection of parts in D_j

Basically - we want to maximize

E = 2d arr
for m in D:
    for n in D:
        E[m][n] = E_m_m * z[m][n] 
            <- E_m_m is the  weight confidence

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungarian_algorithm is used for the matching
