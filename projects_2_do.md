Sometimes I forget the projects had planned, better to write it down here.

## Ideas
- Puzzles
  - [GPU Puzzles](https://github.com/srush/GPU-Puzzles)
  - [Transformer Puzzles](https://github.com/srush/Transformer-Puzzles)

- (WIP) Implement, and evaluate some embeddings `nlp/embeddings-experiments`
  - [Check out this](https://twitter.com/abacaj/status/1656323023937368065)

- (WIP) Implement the [forward-forward algorithm](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.13345) 

- [Adversarial Examples Are Not Bugs, They Are Features](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.02175.pdf) has some cool plots, can you reproduce some of them ?
