Sometimes I forget the projects I had planned, better to write it down here.

## Ideas
- Puzzles
  - [GPU Puzzles](https://github.com/srush/GPU-Puzzles)
  - [Transformer Puzzles](https://github.com/srush/Transformer-Puzzles)
  - [LLM training puzzle](https://github.com/srush/LLM-Training-Puzzles)
  - [Trition puzzles](https://github.com/srush/Triton-Puzzles)

- Implement [spreading vectors for similarity search](./notes/search.md)

- Using ML for generating of fuzzing inputs

- Look at, and ideally break down core parts of the paper and code for [Adding Conditional Control to Text-to-Image Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.05543) [Adding Conditional Control to Text-to-Image Diffusion Models(code)](https://github.com/lllyasviel/ControlNet)

- Take a look at [feature-across-time](https://github.com/EleutherAI/features-across-time/tree/main)
