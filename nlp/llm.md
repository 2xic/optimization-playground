## Large language models

### [Language Models Can Teach Themselves to Use Tools](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2302.04761.pdf)
Language models are good at a lot of complicated tasks, but somtimes not the very good at things like simple math questions. The authors therefore learned the model to use a API to ge tthe best of both worlds.
The way this is done is give the LLM a few exampels of how to use the tool, and have an external script be able to handle the results.

### [Large Language Models are Zero-Shot Reasoners](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.11916)
Show that models are able to reason by just prompting it with "let's think step by step".

### [Large Language Models Are Human-Level Prompt Engineers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.01910)
Shows that using automated generated prompts outperforms the prior baseline.
The automatic prompt engineer is trained by given an demostration (for instance some input + output), and the LLM outputs a set of instructions candiates, the output is scored and filtered then executed and evaluated.
