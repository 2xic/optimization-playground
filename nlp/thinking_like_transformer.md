What is the computational framework for how to think about Transformers ? We know RNN have parallels with finite state machines, but what about transformers ?  

They create a language (RASP) to make it possible to "think" like a transformers without the neural net overhead. This way they can reason about the capabilities of the transformer without needing the neural net.
