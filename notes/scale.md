## [Scaling Laws for Autoregressive Generative Modeling](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.14701)
- Cross-entropy scaling laws are seen in four domains
  - generative image modeling
  - multimodal image <> text
  - video modeling
  - mathematical problem solving
- All modalities also seem to scale the same away
- Transformers are great?

## [On the Predictability of Pruning Across Scales](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.10621)
- Interesting paper: can we predict the error rate of a pruned network ? 
  - They mostly study resnet like architectures
- See figure 7 and figure 8 for context

## [gzip Predicts Data-dependent Scaling Laws](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.16684)
[Twitter thread](https://x.com/khoomeik/status/1795477359933706272)

1. Scaling laws are sensitive to the complexity of the dataset
2. gzip is a good predictor of said complexity

- Many benchmark results will improve when the model is scaled up, but what kind of tasks do worse on a bigger model ?
