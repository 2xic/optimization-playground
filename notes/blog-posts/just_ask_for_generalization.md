### [Just Ask for Generalization](https://evjang.com/2021/10/23/generalization.html)
References recent discoveries to make the point that "large amount of data are more important to generalization than clever model bias", and that if one believes this the model generalization will be proportional to how much diverse data can be fed into the model.

Neural network are sponges, and to further build upon this claim the author mentions concepts like "double decent", and "grooking" (the fact that a model can generalize way later).
