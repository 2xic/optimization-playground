- "Diffusion models are autoencoders"
  - Makes sense, they have this good image as visualization also. Both denosing autoencoders and diffusion models are trying to solve the same problem in some regards.

- "Diffusion models are recurrent neural networks"
  - I guess that is also true some regard.

TLDR: diffusion models are everything we built before ....
