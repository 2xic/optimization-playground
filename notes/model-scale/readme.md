## [Neural scaling laws](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neural_scaling_law)

How does model size, data size and compute affect the results of a model ? Lets find out.

There is this [Awesome-ScalingLaws](https://github.com/RZFan525/Awesome-ScalingLaws) page on github with some good papers, but sadly not updated.

Most scaling laws today work on upstream tasks (i.e predicting things like the loss), but we want scaling laws that can predict downstream tasks (i.e predicting things like the accuracy on some underlying dataset).
