###  [Jared Kaplan | Scaling Laws and Their Implications for Coding AI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Suhp3OLASSo) 
- Same model, different data.
  - Reusing the transformer model at various tasks with great results.
- You see it happens on multiple data distributions
    - Optimal model size also seems to be universal 
- Code is useful to train on for many reasons
  - There is a lot of it
  - It has structure
  - People who do ML knows about it
  - Can be automatically tested with unit tests etc
  - Surrounding information like git
  -
