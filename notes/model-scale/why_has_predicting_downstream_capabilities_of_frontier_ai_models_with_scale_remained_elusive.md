## [Why Has Predicting Downstream Capabilities of Frontier AI Models with Scale Remained Elusive?](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.04391)
- There is good litterateur for describing relationships between parameters, data, compute and the pre-training loss
- There is a lot less on how it would affect downstream tasks.

They compute some metrics for 
- Correlation between correct choices and FLOPs
- One thing they point out is that we need to look at not only the probability mass on correct answers, but also the incorrect ones.
