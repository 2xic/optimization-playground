### [Broken Neural Scaling Laws](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.14891.pdf)
- The word broken refers to broken power laws (sequence of conjoined power laws), and not the fact that neural scaling laws are broken
- One of the reasons this better than other proposed scaling laws is that this method better covers the double decent phenomena.

- Interesting fellow. He also promised one [1B](https://twitter.com/ethanCaballero/status/1587502829580820481) to those who can disprove the claims from the paper.
