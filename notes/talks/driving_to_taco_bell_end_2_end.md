### [Driving to Taco Bell with end-to-end ML](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zu5OFv3pzRU)

## What took time
- Architecture redesign ( refactoring and simplifications )
- Architecture design
  - They previously believed they could use segnets for some of their simulation work where they used a offset and project to simulate movement in a image, but that did not work as especially lights and shadow are hard to project  
  - See [learning a driving simulator](./learning_a_driving_simulator.md) for more.
- Fixing model bugs (problems with the simulator)
