- Most doomers think all problems can be solved by thinking vs engineering
  - Many things require real world feedback 
- Humanity has seen many shifts in IQ and those people with higher IQ have not been any more dangerous than others
- Most processes are self-limiting -> "intelligence explosion" would be hard

- There is no exponential increase in capabilities
- The exception of rapid feedback does not seem to have happened
- Capabilities will not increase without resource usage (at least for now)
- The feedback loop after launch does not seem to be working "as planned"
