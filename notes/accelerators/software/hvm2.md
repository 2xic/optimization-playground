- [Good video on it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HCOQmKTFzYY)
- Computation is sorted in a graph (`INTERACTION COMBINATORS`)
  - Certain edges can be rewritten into ways to make things happen in parallel
- Author has some video with the origins on [Youtube also](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UQNNs77SpXA)
