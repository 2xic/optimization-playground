## Tesla Dojo
So Dojo is the name of the super computer that tesla uses for training, but it's based on their own chip (D1) so that makes it worth exploring.

- RISC-V like architecture with some custom instructions for vectors.
- Tesla does various tradeoffs that makes life harder for people working with the chip, but the gain is that they get more performance.
