World first transform ASIC, beats the best existing GPUs in terms of token per second*.

*The benchmark they have used have been questioned on [twitter](https://x.com/Tim_Dettmers/status/1805701944746590549) though.

- They don't make it clear what kind of transformers they support
  - i.e what if the winning transformation model will be sparse, will the asic support it ? 
- They don't make it clear what how the hardware adapts to change in weights and attention sizes

- TLDR, they posted a misleading blogpost
