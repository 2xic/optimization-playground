# Brain and compute
Mostly me logging some numbers fro further reference.

## Hans Moravec
The brain does between $10^{12}$ and $10^{14}$ [1][2]

He also made the [prediction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hans_Moravec#Predictions) that the amount of compute would be avaible for 2000$ (adjusted for [inflation](https://www.in2013dollars.com/us/inflation/1997?amount=1000)) in the mid 2020s (which is at the time of writing). 
[Xander Dunn](https://x.com/xanderai/status/1907137550902608233) flagged this prediction and also mentioned that the [NVIDIA B100](https://www.techpowerup.com/gpu-specs/b100.c4275) does $10Â¨{15}$ BF16 FLOPs, but that does cost $30 000.

## Nick Bostrom
The brain does between $10^{14}$ and $10^{17}$ [1]
