### [Deep Learning Iteration](https://medium.com/@xanderdunn/deep-learning-iteration-324487da5888)
- Buy GPUs for faster iteration speed
- Write unit tests for custom operations
- Use simple method for evaluation while training and more complex when testing
  - i.e accept some variance in the test scores while training to speed up the training and run deeper evaluation when testing
