### Notes form the paper

- PArt Affinity Fields (PAFs) -> method for nonparametric representation
  - set of 2D vector fields that encode the location, and orientation of limbs over the image domain
- Bottom up style system with high accuracy, and realtime performance

Why bottom up is good: 
- Since keypoint detect is a hard problem some could try a top down apporach by using a "person" detector to first detect the person, and then estimate the keypoints
  - Problem here is if the person detector fails if people are to close for instance
  - The run time is also proportional to the number of people in the image
  
Image pipeline
- image input to CNN that predicts confidence map for body part and PAFs for part association
  - Feedforward network that produces 
    - a set of 2D confidence maps of body locations (S)
      - The set S has J confidence maps, one per part
    - a set of 2D vector fields (L)
      - The set L has C vector fields, one per limb
    - 2D keypoints are generated by *greedy inference* 
      - TODO: Look this up, they refer to it as some earlier work
  - For the structure of the network see Fig. 3
    - They write it in a complicated way, but sounds like the have the first state which they rerun for a given T_p
    - Then they run stage_2 also multiple times with a constatn T_c 
- Then a parsing set performance a set of bipartitle matching to associate body part candidates
- We finally assemble them into full body poses for all people in the image

Training pipeline
- Two losses    
  - One for the confidence map
  - One for the parity fields
- Generation of confidence maps
    - There is a algorithm 7 and 8 that describes how this is done
    - Look also at algo 8 and 9
- FInding the body pose ->
  - Look at algorithm 13 -> 15
