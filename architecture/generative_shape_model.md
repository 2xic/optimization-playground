### [Generative Shape Models: Joint Text Recognition and Segmentation with Very Little Training Data](https://vcrs.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/1611.02788.pdf)
1. Using generatives model can help with training instead of using a lot of data.
2. The other part of the model is the parsing model which gets out the
