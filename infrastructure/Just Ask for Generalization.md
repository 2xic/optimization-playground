### [Just Ask for Generalization](https://evjang.com/2021/10/23/generalization.html)
References recent discoveries to make the point that "large amount of data are more important to generelization than cleaver model bias", and that if one belives this the model generelization will be propotional to how much diverse data can be fed into the model.

Neural network are sponges, and to further build upon this claim the author mentions concepts like "double decent", and "grooking" (the fact that a model can generalize way later).
