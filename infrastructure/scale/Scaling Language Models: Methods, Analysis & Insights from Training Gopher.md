### [Scaling Language Models: Methods, Analysis & Insights from Training Gopher](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.11446.pdf)
- Looking at the effect of scaling the model parameters size, and do various analysis on the model (for instance on the toxicity) 
- The big model does quite well on various tasks, but the smaller ones not so much (This is also mentioned in [training compute optimal large models](./training%20Compute-Optimal%20Large%20Language%20Models.md))
