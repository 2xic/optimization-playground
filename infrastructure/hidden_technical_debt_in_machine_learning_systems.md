- Not all debt is bad, but all debt has to be served
  - Technical debt need to be served
    - Refactoring code
    - Improving tests
    - Deleting dead code
    - etc
- Authors argue that ML have their own specific problems in addition to the classical technical debt issues 
    - i.e small changes in data pipelines can throw the models off
      - high entanglement in the ml system
    - transfer learning on other models can create unwanted dependencies 
    - undeclared consumers
      - Depending on how you make the output available, it might be used by other system without you knowing
        - me: Not sure if I agree so much with this point, but the other made sense
    - Data dependencies
      - Unstable signals from data pipelines (i.e data that updates over time)
        - can be solved with data version tracking
    - Underutilized data dependencies
      - legacy features
      - epsilon features (added for a small accuracy boost)
      - correlated features
    - Feedback loops
      - Model might affect the training data in some way
    - Anti patterns
      - Making code dependent on glue code because of 2 general packages
        - use abstract interfaces!!!
      - Pipeline jungels
        - lol
- Monitor and testing
  - Monitor
    - Action limit
      - if a certaint action is preformed 2 much in real world, send a warning
    - Prediction bias
      - Check that distribution of predicted labels is matching that of the observed labels
      - 
  - Testing
    - End to end testing is important
    - Unit testing is important
- Good question 2 ask
  - How easily can a new algorithm be trained on this stack ?
  - How precisely can changes to the system be measured ?
  - How easily can a new person learn the stack ?
