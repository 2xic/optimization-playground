## [Training Agents Inside of Scalable World Models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.24527)
- RL inside a world model.
- Improving upon [OpenAI VPT offline agent](https://openai.com/index/vpt/) and using 100x data
- Flow matching and diffusion modeling. [Shortcut models also](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.12557)
- Trained in three phases
  - World model pre-training.
  - Agent fine-tuning
  - Imagination training
- Shortcut forcing and efficient transformer architecture seems like what was most important.
- Images are here high resolution
