Implementation of various machine learning related algorithms. 

## Sales pitch

You like GAN ? We got GAN that [generates images](./gan/gan-hacks/readme.md) and GAN that learns to [communicate secretly](./gan/learning-to-protect-communication/readme.md).
Don't like the style of GANs ? We got [style transfer](./computer-vision/style-transfer/readme.md).
You want explainability ? We got [RISE](./computer-vision/rise/rise.ipynb). Embeddings ? We got [CLIP](./computer-vision/clip/readme.md) that gives you both image and text embedding (two for one!)!
You prefer research on the architecture related questions ? I understand, we got [forward forward](./architecture/forward-forward/the_forward_forward_algorithm.md) and [synthetic gradients](./architecture/decoupled_neural_interfaces_using_synthetic_gradients/decoupled_neural_interfaces_using_synthetic_gradients.md).
Scale ? We have studied scale like [double decent](./playground/double-decenet/readme.md).

For a more concrete list of implementations done you can see the [readme](./readme.md) for each specific year (I'll create a clean table in the future).
