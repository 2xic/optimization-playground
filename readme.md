### Reflection from 2022
(See `2022..md` for the things i looked at last year)

The paper table from `2022` got messy, so to make things easier this year we simplified the table.

I still believe there was a lot of value in moving quick between papers, but one thing I should be better at this year is visualization. In addition to give myself two weeks instead of one on the larger projects / more complicated papers.

The paper notes also got messy, aim at writing more clean and easier to digest paper notes like [https://github.com/dennybritz/deeplearning-papernotes](https://github.com/dennybritz/deeplearning-papernotes)

Writing this to keep myself accountable.
