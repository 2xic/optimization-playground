[Scaling GAIA-1: 9-billion parameter generative world model for autonomous driving](https://wayve.ai/thinking/scaling-gaia-1/)
- The results looks very good 
- Prompts are used to condition the environment
- 

Model
- "GAIA-1â€™s world model has 6.5 billion parameters and was trained for 15 days on 64 NVIDIA A100s" (direct quote)
