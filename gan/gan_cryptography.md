Quite an interesting idea, no predefined algorithm is set, but two parties wish to communicate securely while having a "man in the middle" that can read the messages.

Both communicator have a shared key, and are easily able to decrypt the message, and wish to make the output of the "man in the middle" as noisy as possible.
